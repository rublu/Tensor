# Tensor
This folder contains most of my work I did in training in Mindtree Ltd. as an intern/trainee in deep learning algorithms.


I have included the documentation of the project that I have submitted finally. 
I have mentioned all the works and research done in details.
I have also included all the steps to run this program from scratch (Already a trained model is included in the folder) i.e from installing
python and tensor flow to executing programs in details step by step.

Thank You.
